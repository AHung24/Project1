<h2>Top 5 Travel Destinations</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Japan</li>
    <p>I've been to Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, Kyoto, Nagasaki, and Kumamoto. Out of all the cities I've been to in Japan, my favorite would be Fukuoka because the city felt more quiet and slow. There weren't many tourists there (from what I noticed). The best food I had in Fukuoka was the sashimi; we went to a restaurant that had high quality fish. My favorite was the mackerel because of the texture; it is more firm than other fish.  </p>

    <li>Taipei, Taiwan</li>
    <p>Taipei's nightmarkets are one of my favorite parts of the city. Although the architecture is older than Osaka's, there is still a lot of great things around. The city and culture felt more fast paced than America. The food in Taiwan is delicious; my favorite thing I ate there was the sticky rice rolls with pork floss inside. While we were there, we went to the NBA Store, a store dedicated to selling NBA merch; I have not seen a store like that in America. </p>

    <li>Hong Kong</li>
    <p>Hong Kong, where my family is from, is on my list because of the food. Whenever we go to Hong Kong, I always end up eating so much; we mainly have dim sum whenever we go out with my grandma. From the street food to sit-down restaurants, Hong Kong food will always be my go to. Not only is the food good, but so is there public transportation; the subway is clean and can get you anywhere and the buses are clean and are always on time. While there are many positives, the one downside is that it gets really hot and humid during the summer. Overall, while I may be based, Hong Kong is still one of my favorite places to go.</p>

    <li>England</li>
    <p>
        England was nice to travel to because of the blend of historical and modern architecture. Walking through cities like London and the town of Chester made me admire the contrast in the two. The cathedrals gave me a glimpse into the past, while contemporary buildings showcased innovation The weather was hot as we had traveled there during the heart of the summer season. What made it even worse was that there was no air conditioning anywhere. Despite the lack of cooling, I still enjoyed traveling here.

    <li>Seattle, Washington</li>
    <p>
        Seattle had an amazing mix of urban and natural beauty. Visiting Pike Place Market was a highlight because of the first Starbucks and its iconic sign. The coffee culture in the city was incredible. I felt like there were great cafe's and great pastries everywhere. We also went to the Space Needle which offered a panoramic view of the city.

<h2>
    Top 5 Foods
</h2>
<p>
    I have many favorite foods from a range of cultures. Starting from Japanese cuisine and ending with Italian, I enjoy foods from all over the world. I don't think I'm a picky eater because I will eat almost everything. Lets begin the list off with my frist favorite food!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sashimi</li>
    <p><em><a href = "https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2044.html">Sashimi</a></em> is one of my favorite foods because I rarely get to eat it due to the price. My favorite aspect of sashimi is the texture of the fish; I lean more towards more firm fish such as mackerel and yellowtail. I am also a fan of the minimal prep that goes into the dish; without a lot of prep, the flavor of the fish is highlighted. If I had the money, I would have sashimi a lot more.</p>

    <li>Chow Mein</li>
    <p>I have always been more of a noodle person rather than rice; I think it is mainly because of how I was brought up. Growing up, we ate a lot more rice than noodles which made me sick of it. My favorite type of chow mein is the <em><a href = "https://cjeatsrecipes.com/shanghai-fried-noodles/">Shanghai Chow Mein</a></em> which usually has green onions, a protein, mushrooms, and onions. I am a fan of the noodles in <em>Shanhai Chow Mein</em> because of the texture and bounce it has when bitten into. My second type of chow mein dish is chow fun which is made with flat noodles. It is also the texture that makes it one of my favorites.</p>

    </a>


    <li>Any Type of Pasta</li>
    <p>I love pasta because it is the perfect combination of flavor and texture. I tend to lean more towards red sauce over white sauce because it doesn't feel as heavy to me. The variety of shapes and sauces means there is always something new to try and makes it impossible to find it repetitive. It also doesn't take too much time to make which makes it my go to meal when I want something that tastes good without too much effort.

    </a>
    
    <li>Anything Noodles</li>
    <p>
        From stir-fry to soup, I am a large noodle lover. As mentioned before, I grew up eating a lot more rice dishes than noodle dishes which has made me lean more towards <em><a href="https://www.2foodtrippers.com/best-noodle-dishes-in-the-world/
        ">noodles</a></em>. I am also a large texture eater which makes me enjoy noodles a lot more. There’s something about the texture that makese every dish satisfying. One of my favorites is spicy beef noodle soup because of the falvorful broth and hand-pulled noodles that soak up all the flavor. Another go-to is pho because of the simplicity and the flavor punching broth. If there are noodles on the menu, then I am definitely ordering them.

    <li>Pizza</li>
    <p>
       <em><a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/101/types-of-pizza.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo78AHDBgGenlzYCsEY_p2fIWqpKzih4L5EGhLL72lo7NBLDZsX">Pizza</a></em> is one of my favorites because of the endless customization, sharability, and delicious flavors. It works for any occasion; it could be a quick and easy meal or a gathering with friends. As mentioned, I like how customizable it is, so there’s always something new to try. It’s also convenient and never feels like a hassle to eat; however it is often greasy. Despite the greasiness, pizza always hits the spot.
