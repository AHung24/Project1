    My name is Austin and I am a graphic designer studying visual communication design at San Francisco State University and graduating in May 2025. My goal is to enter the digital marketing world as well as work with social media. Design is an outlet for me to creatively express myself. Throughout my academic career, I have learned to layout, apply design principles, and color techniques to create a cohesive design that captures the audeince's attention. My university journey has been the ride of a lifetime. Starting at Biola University and returning to Skyline Community College to transfer to SF State University has taught me that change is inevitable in one's life. My professional career has taught me that there will always be opportunities everywhere even if I aren't accepted into them. Jobs and internships come and go, but it is still good to apply even if I know I won't get in. All of these experiences have shaped my persistence and has furthered my passion for design and digital marketing. As I prepare to graduate from SF State, I am excited to apply my new and growing skills to a real-world setting. I look forward to creating impactful designs that capture audeinces. As I continue my journey as a designer, my skills will continue to grow and I am excited to learn from those more experienced.
