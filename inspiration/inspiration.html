<h3>
    Artist 1: <a href="https://www.banksy.co.uk/">Banksy</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Banksy's artstyle inspires me beacuse of the message and meaning behind each artwork. With each art piece he creates, he criticizes a larger issue. An example of this would be his "Flower Thrower" art piece which features a masked man throwing a boquet of flowers. This highlights the use of violence and war and ultimately turning to peace and love. I am inspired by the way he turns larger issues into art pieces to create a discussion about it and to hopefully create change in society.

    Artist 2: <a href="https://www.warhol.org/">Andy Warhol</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Another artist that inspires me is Andy Warhol. I am mainly inspired by his use of colors. Each color palette that he chooses features colors that popping off the artwork and is also loud. Often times, whenever I make my designs, I will opt for a more minimalistic approach, but I want to encorporate Warhol's approach of using loud and popping colors. I think this is a great way of getting the audience's attention. I think that the use of color is one of the key ways of getting the audience's attention and without a cohesive palette, there would be no interest in the design.

    Artist 3: <a href="https://brandontam.squarespace.com/work">Brandon Tam</a>
</h3>
    <p>
        My final inspiration is Brandon Tam, who is a graphic designer from the Bay Area; he started his journey because of his love for drawing and illustration. He was hired by the 49ers as their designer and ultimately moved his way up to be the senior designer. He has worked with Raheem Mostert, a running back for the Miami Dolphins, as well as many other famous athletes and companies. His journey has inspired me to continue my journey as a graphic designer and hopefully I can make it to the level that he is at.
