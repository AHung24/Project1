        <h3>Artist 1: Banksy</h3>
        <p>
            Banksy's artstyle inspires me because of the message and meaning behind each artwork. With each art piece he creates, he criticizes a larger issue. An example of this would be his "Flower Thrower" art piece, which features a masked man throwing a bouquet of flowers. This highlights the use of violence and war and ultimately turning to peace and love. I am inspired by the way he turns larger issues into art pieces to create a discussion about it and to hopefully create change in society.

        <h3>Artist 2: Andy Warhol</h3>
        <p>
            Another artist that inspires me is Andy Warhol. I am mainly inspired by his use of colors. Each color palette that he chooses features colors that pop off the artwork and are also loud. Oftentimes, whenever I make my designs, I will opt for a more minimalistic approach, but I want to incorporate Warhol's approach of using loud and popping colors. I think this is a great way of getting the audience's attention. I think that the use of color is one of the key ways of getting the audience's attention, and without a cohesive palette, there would be no interest in the design.

        <h3>Artist 3: Brandon Tam</h3>
        <p>
            My final inspiration is Brandon Tam, a graphic designer from the Bay Area; he started his journey because of his love for drawing and illustration. He was hired by the 49ers as their designer and ultimately moved up to become the senior designer. He has worked with Raheem Mostert, a running back for the Miami Dolphins, as well as many other famous athletes and companies. His journey has inspired me to continue my own journey as a graphic designer, and hopefully, I can make it to the level that he is at.
